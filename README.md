# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
Predykcja prze≈ºycia na Titanicu

In this project, 4 classification methods were used to predict the survival of Titanic passengers. 
These are K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. 
Each method was implemented in Python in the Jupyter Notebook environment. 
Passenger data was analyzed, processed, and used to train the models.
The models were tested for accuracy and compared.
